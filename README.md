# Shimmer Widget 
A simple Flutter widget that adds a moving shimmer (loading) effect to any child widget.

# How it works
The shimmer uses an animation controller and a linear gradient that moves from left to right, making your widget look like it’s glowing or loading.

# Key Features

Easy to use — just wrap any widget.

Smooth left-to-right shimmer animation.

Customizable duration and colors (if needed).

# Explanation
AnimationController: Controls the shimmer motion (from 0 to 1).

ShaderMask: Paints the moving light over your widget.

LinearGradient: Creates the shiny effect.

# How to Run
1. Clone or copy the shimmer widget code into your Flutter project.
2. Make sure you have Flutter installed and set up.
3. In your project folder, run:
-flutter pub get
-flutter run
4. In the app you'll see the clickable buttons click one "BUY BTC", input "0.1" and there you will see the shimmer effect.
